1 Description

The main purpose of this project is to apply different classification algorithms on CIFAR-10 dataset and analyze the results. CIFAR-10 dataset is a labeled subset of 80 million tiny images dataset. It consists of 60,000 32Ã—32 color images in 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck) with 6,000 images per class. From the 60,000 images, there are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. 

2 Classification Algorithms

In the project, I will apply linear regression, support vector and neural networks to the dataset. As for linear regression, I plan to use least square method and cross validation to train the linear regression model before applying the model to test data and analyzing the performance. For support vector, I am going to find a good boundary for classification and test its effect. About neural networks, I plan to construct a network for classification with several hidden layers by using different functions. Finally, after comparing the performances of all of the algorithms, I will analyze and find the advantages and disadvantages of them.
